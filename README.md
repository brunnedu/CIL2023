This repository contains the code of our group project for the Computational Intelligence Lab (SS23 ETH ZÃ¼rich).


## Image Collection
Additional training images can be collected using the `src/image_collection.py` script.
The script requires a valid Google Maps API key in the `GMAPS_API_KEY` environment variable.
Usage can be checked using `python src/image_collection.py --help`

### Location Config
The location config acts as an input to the image collection process.
The `bbox` property describes the bounding box of the specific location.
The first value corresponds to the upper-left corner and the second to the lower-right corner.
