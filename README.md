# CIL Road Segmentation Project
This repository contains the code of our group project for the Computational Intelligence Lab (SS23 ETH ZÃ¼rich).

# Setup
We recommend using the conda package manager. Navigate to the CIL2023 folder and run:\
`conda create --name cil python=3.8`\
`conda activate cil`\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can then train the model by executing: \
`python main.py train "./data" -n`

To see a list of all available commands type: \
